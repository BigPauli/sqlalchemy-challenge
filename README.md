# sqlalchemy-challenge
The main idea of this project is to show proficiency with SQLAlchemy and Flask in tandem with SQLAlchemy

### climate.ipynb
This script explores weather data in Hawaii from the hawaii.sqlite file. It explores precipitation and temperature data within the final year of measurements and plots the data using pandas and matplotlib

### app.py
This script creates a flask app that pulls the same data from climate.ipynb and displays it as a webpage using Flask.

All code was written by me with some help from the internet. Sources were cited in the comments of the code when used.
